# soundBlast
Basic .wav music file player built for python. Confirmed working with Windows OS.

## Usage

Drag .wav files into the Soundblast folder at the top most level (root).

Failing to place .wav files in the top level of the folder (by placing .wav 
files in a folder within the Soundblast folder) will result in the program 
not working properly.

Right click main.py and edit with python IDLE. (Comes pre-installed with MacOS)
In Line 11 where it reads FOLDER_PATH, add your username where indicated, and then save the changes.

Create a new folder in Desktop named 'Soundblast', and add main.py and the desired
.wav files into the folder.

Then double click main.py to begin the program.
