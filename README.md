# Soundblast
Extremely basic .wav music file player, based in python. Confirmed working with Windows OS.

## Usage

Drag .wav files into the Soundblast folder at the top most level (root).

Failing to place .wav files in the top level of the folder (by placing .wav 
files in a folder within the Soundblast folder) will result in the program 
not working properly.

Then double click main.py to begin the program.
